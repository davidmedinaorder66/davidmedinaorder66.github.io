<td>  <left>Known as May the 4th, Star Wars Day celebrates the creation of Jedi history,
 Skywalkers, Baby Yoda, Han Solo, Chewbacca and Darth Vader, as well as the rest of the characters,
that have marked pop culture over the decades.<br>

How did the celebration come about and why May 4?
It is recorded that the first celebration of Star Wars Day was in Toronto, back in 2011, <br>
when a fan event was organized with activities alluding to the saga,<br>
 from trivia, costume contest and the screening of the first films<br>

The reason why it is celebrated exactly on May 4 is linked to one of its <br>
most famous quotes: May The Force Be With You, fans decided to set the special day on May 4,<br>
the wordplay and pronunciation in English, which is May the 4th (fourth) </left></td>
